Okay, I understand. It's frustrating when things aren't working as expected, and sometimes a fresh start or perspective is helpful.

Here is a detailed prompt summarizing the project context, refactoring plan, progress so far, and the current sticking point. You can use this to brief a new chat session.

Context Prompt for Cosmic Voyage Refactoring (Continuation)

Project: Cosmic Voyage (TypeScript/Vite ASCII space roguelike game)

Overall Goal: Refactor the existing codebase to make it more modular, understandable, maintainable, and extensible.

Methodology: We are following an incremental, multi-step refactoring plan, aiming to avoid breaking functionality at each stage and making small, verifiable changes.

Refactoring Plan (5 Steps):

    Introduce Event Bus/Mediator: Decouple core components using a custom pub/sub event manager (src/core/event_manager.ts). (Status: Complete)
    Refine State Management & Entity Logic: Separate data (Components) from logic (Systems), moving towards an ECS-lite pattern, starting with the Player entity. (Status: Mostly Complete)
    Modularize Generation Logic: Break down large generator files (planet_characteristics_generator.ts, surface_generator.ts) into smaller, focused modules. (Status: In Progress)
    Separate Input Mapping from Action Execution: Ensure InputManager purely maps raw input to abstract actions, while Game (or dedicated systems) handles action consequences based on game state. (Status: Not Started)
    Organize Configuration and Constants: Improve clarity and structure within config.ts and constants.ts. (Status: Not Started)

Current Progress Details:

    Step 1 (Event Bus):
        EventManager created and implemented.
        Decoupling achieved via events for:
            GameStateManager state changes -> Game.
            Game status updates -> RendererFacade (STATUS_UPDATE_NEEDED).
            ActionProcessor state transition requests -> GameStateManager (ENTER_SYSTEM_REQUESTED, etc.).
            ActionProcessor action requests (Trade, Refuel, Mine) -> Game (TRADE_REQUESTED, etc.).
            Game player movement -> MovementSystem via MOVE_REQUESTED event.
            Scan logic decoupled: ActionProcessor signals intent (requestScan, requestSystemPeek), Game handles context and triggers popup.
        ActionProcessor dependency on GameStateManager for peekAtSystem removed (handled by Game via requestSystemPeek).
        Redundant "initiated" messages removed from ActionProcessor.

    Step 2 (State/Entity Logic - Player Focus):
        Component interfaces defined (src/core/components.ts): PositionComponent, RenderComponent, ResourceComponent, CargoComponent.
        Player class (src/core/player.ts) refactored: Properties replaced with instances of the above components.
        Core classes (Game, GameStateManager, SceneRenderer) updated to access Player data via components (e.g., player.position.worldX, player.resources.fuel).
        MovementSystem created (src/systems/movement_system.ts) and integrated: Handles MOVE_REQUESTED event and updates player.position. Original movement methods removed from Player.
        CargoSystem created (src/systems/cargo_system.ts) and integrated: Provides cargo utility methods. Game handlers (_handleMineRequest, _handleTradeRequest) updated to use CargoSystem methods. Original cargo methods removed from Player.
        ElementInfo interface in src/constants.ts updated to include required fields (typeHints, isGas, etc.), and ELEMENTS constant data populated.

    Step 3 (Modularize Generation Logic):
        planet_characteristics_generator.ts successfully modularized: Logic extracted into physical_generator.ts, atmosphere_generator.ts, temperature_calculator.ts, surface_descriptor.ts, and resource_generator.ts. The main file now imports and orchestrates calls to these modules.
        Current Task Attempted: Started modularizing src/entities/planet/surface_generator.ts. The plan was to extract the heightmap generation logic into a new file (src/entities/planet/heightmap_generator.ts) and update surface_generator.ts to call it.
        Stalling Point: Attempting to implement the extraction of heightmap generation caused bugs or issues that prevented proceeding. The last proposed action (which led to this pause) was to create heightmap_generator.ts and modify surface_generator.ts.

Codebase State:

    The latest verified code state corresponds to commit 4c39e4ed... (or the code provided just before the attempt to create heightmap_generator.ts). All changes related to Steps 1 and 2, and the successful modularization of planet_characteristics_generator.ts are included. Movement functionality is confirmed working with the MovementSystem.

Instruction for New LLM Instance:

Please review the current state and the plan for Step 3 (modularizing surface_generator.ts). The immediate next task was to extract the heightmap generation logic from surface_generator.ts into a new heightmap_generator.ts module. Verify the proposed code changes for this step and assist in debugging or correctly implementing this extraction to proceed with Step 3.

Some things to remember:

If a lot of detailed changes have happened within a single file, rewrite the whole file - and make it clear that the file is a whole rewrite.
If it's a moderate cut and paste but not worth doing a full rewrite, indicate this clearly and also indicate clearly where to put the code.
If it's just one or two lines, indicate this clearly and also indicate clearly where to put the code.
Remember to take care and carefully consider each change.
